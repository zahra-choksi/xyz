## Problem Statement

In India, A Large Portion Of The Population—especially In Tier 2/3 Cities And Rural Areas—struggles To Understand Medical Prescriptions Due To Language Barriers, Technical Jargon, And Low Health Literacy. Elderly Patients And Non-english Speakers Often Misinterpret Medicine Usage, Dosage, Or Potential Side Effects, Which Can Lead To Serious Health Risks. This Communication Gap Between Patients And Healthcare Professionals Is A Major Challenge In Ensuring Safe And Effective Treatment Adherence. There Is A Clear Need For A Simple, Accessible Tool That Explains Medicine Information In Local Languages To Empower Users And Improve Healthcare Outcomes.


## Brief Description Of Our Idea

- “Medguide” Is A Mobile/Web App That Allows Users To Either Type Or Scan A Medicine Name To Receive Easy-to-understand Explanations In Their Preferred Local Language (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Etc.). The App Provides Information Such As The Medicine’s Use, Dosage, And Common Side Effects Using A Hardcoded Database Of 50+ Common Drugs. The Mvp Focuses On Accessibility And User-friendliness, Especially For Elderly Or Non-english-speaking Users. Future Versions Can Integrate With Indiastack Elements Like Digilocker Or Health Id For Prescription Retrieval And Personalized Guidance.
