![MedGuide Banner](Med.png)

## Overview
WE ARE BUILDING A MOBILE/WEB SOFTWARE SOLUTION THAT LEVERAGES LANGUAGE LOCALIZATION AND OCR TO SIMPLIFY MEDICINE-RELATED INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS. THE PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE INDIASTACK THEME THROUGH FUTURE INTEGRATION WITH HEALTH-RELATED DIGITAL SERVICES LIKE DIGILOCKER AND ABHA HEALTH RECORDS.

## Social Impact
MEDGUIDE‚Äù EMPOWERS PATIENTS IN TIER 2/3 CITIES AND RURAL INDIA BY TRANSLATING COMPLEX MEDICAL INFORMATION INTO LOCAL LANGUAGES. IT PROMOTES MEDICINE SAFETY, REDUCES HEALTH RISKS DUE TO MISINTERPRETATION, AND SUPPORTS ELDERLY AND LOW-LITERACY USERS. THE SOLUTION BRIDGES THE COMMUNICATION GAP BETWEEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

## Problem Statement

IN INDIA, A LARGE PORTION OF THE POPULATION‚ÄîESPECIALLY IN TIER 2/3 CITIES AND RURAL AREAS‚ÄîSTRUGGLES TO UNDERSTAND MEDICAL PRESCRIPTIONS DUE TO LANGUAGE BARRIERS, TECHNICAL JARGON, AND LOW HEALTH LITERACY. ELDERLY PATIENTS AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS OFTEN MISINTERPRET MEDICINE USAGE, DOSAGE, OR POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS. THIS COMMUNICATION GAP BETWEEN PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN ENSURING SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT ADHERENCE. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR A SIMPLE, ACCESSIBLE TOOL THAT EXPLAINS MEDICINE INFORMATION IN LOCAL LANGUAGES TO EMPOWER USERS AND IMPROVE HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES.

## Brief Description Of Our Idea

- ‚ÄúMEDGUIDE‚Äù IS A MOBILE/WEB APP THAT ALLOWS USERS TO EITHER TYPE OR SCAN A MEDICINE NAME TO RECEIVE EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND EXPLANATIONS IN THEIR PREFERRED LOCAL LANGUAGE (HINDI, TAMIL, BENGALI, ETC.). THE APP PROVIDES INFORMATION SUCH AS THE MEDICINE‚ÄôS USE, DOSAGE, AND COMMON SIDE EFFECTS USING A HARDCODED DATABASE OF 50+ COMMON DRUGS. THE MVP FOCUSES ON ACCESSIBILITY AND USER-FRIENDLINESS, ESPECIALLY FOR ELDERLY OR NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING USERS. FUTURE VERSIONS CAN INTEGRATE WITH INDIASTACK ELEMENTS LIKE DIGILOCKER OR HEALTH ID FOR PRESCRIPTION RETRIEVAL AND PERSONALIZED GUIDANCE!
